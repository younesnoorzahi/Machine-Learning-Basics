<h3>Machine Learning Basics in Python</h3>
<p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Below is a structured guide to Machine Learning basics using Python.</p>

<h1>1. Types of Machine Learning</h1>
<p>There are three main types of ML:</p>

<p>

```
Type	| Description |	Example
Supervised: Learning ~	Learns from labeled data (input-output pairs)	~ Predicting house prices
Unsupervised: Learning	~ Finds patterns in unlabeled data ~	Customer segmentation
Reinforcement: Learning ~	Learns by interacting with an environment ~	Game-playing AI (e.g., AlphaGo)</p>
```

<h1>2. Essential Python Libraries for ML</h1>

```

Library	| Purpose
NumPy:	Numerical computing (arrays, matrices)
Pandas:	Data manipulation (DataFrames)
Matplotlib/Seaborn:	Data visualization
Scikit-learn:	ML algorithms (classification, regression, clustering)
TensorFlow/PyTorch:	Deep Learning
```

<p>Install them using:</p>

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

<h1>3. Typical ML Workflow</h1>
<p>1.Data Collection → 2. Data Preprocessing → 3. Model Training → 4. Evaluation → 5. Prediction</p>

<h1>4. Supervised Learning Example (Regression & Classification)</h1>
