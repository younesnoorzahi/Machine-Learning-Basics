<h3>Machine Learning Basics in Python</h3>
<p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Below is a structured guide to Machine Learning basics using Python.</p>

<h1>1. Types of Machine Learning</h1>
<p>There are three main types of ML:</p>

<p>

```
Type	| Description |	Example
Supervised: Learning	Learns from labeled data (input-output pairs)	Predicting house prices
Unsupervised: Learning	Finds patterns in unlabeled data	Customer segmentation
Reinforcement: Learning	Learns by interacting with an environment	Game-playing AI (e.g., AlphaGo)</p>
```
